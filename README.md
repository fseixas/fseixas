### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been working with technology and internet companies for about 25 years now. I worked for some companies as an employee, but my greater knowledge came from founding and running 8 internet companies and mentoring more than 20 other companies.

As the CEO of my companies and mentor of many others I created, developed, worked, learned from many different types of business models. A have knowledge in eCommerce business in Brazil. I also grew a great experience in marketing and online advertising. These experiences, combined with my IT knowledge (mostly development and cloud infrastructure), allowed me to develop skills in growth hacking.

Most recently I put into practice a new passion, the blockchain, and cryptocurrencies. I have been studying it since late 2014, and in 2017 I created a new company in this segment.

Now I run Softo, a software house the offers a new approach to selling software service: DevTeam as a Service.

In the job of creating and growing companies, I managed many aspects, processes, and departments including finance, human sources, IT, marketing, sales, operations, logistics, venture capital investment, and even design.

To put it short I have many skills necessary to run an internet company and any department within.
